Classification of Face mask was done using Vgg16, ResNet152 and detection was done using YOLO V5

YOLO for object detection This code uses the YOLO algorithm for object detection.

Object detection is one of the classic problems in computer vision. It is different from the classification problem and also a bit complex. In object detection, we need to identify where the object is and what the object is. Whereas in the case of a classification problem, we only need to identify which object it is. In object detection, we need to find/find all the objects in the image and draw bounding boxes around them.

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular algorithm used for real-time object detection. It is a convolutional neural network that achieves high accuracy and also has the ability to run in real time.

YOLO only looks once, i.e. it scans the entire image with a single neural network and then divides the images into specific segments or regions. It predicts the bounds or rather bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. YOLO requires only one forward pass for predictions.
